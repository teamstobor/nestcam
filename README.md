# NestCam

## Introduction

This project was made by Team# 684, [STOBOR](http://www.stobor.club). This project was part of First Lego League competition for Animal Allies season (2016-17).

## Purpose

Provide monitored nests for declining bird species. Collect data such as humidity, temparature inside and outside of the bird nests. In the future, make the nest cameras powered entirely by Solar power, use machine learning algorithms to identify presence or count of eggs,hatclings, identify bird species.

## Overview

## Design

We followed the 8 step Engineering Design Process for our project. The following are the steps:

1. Identify the problem
2. Background research
3. Specify requirements
4. Design a solution
5. Make a prototype
6. Test the solution
7. If solution does not meet requirements, go back to step 5. and repeat.
8. Communicate results.

We adopted the above process from [Science Buddies](http://www.sciencebuddies.org/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-process-steps.shtml).
